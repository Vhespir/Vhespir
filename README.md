## 👋 About Me

I'm a computer science student with hands-on experience in Linux system administration, security hardening, and infrastructure monitoring. I run production-grade services on my personal infrastructure and enjoy automating operational tasks.

## 🔧 What I Do

- 🔒 **Security Hardening** - Hardware authentication (FIDO2/U2F), intrusion prevention (fail2ban), endpoint protection (ClamAV)
- 📊 **Infrastructure Monitoring** - Full observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager
- 🐧 **Linux System Administration** - Arch Linux server management, systemd services, network configuration
- 🐳 **Container Orchestration** - Docker containerization, resource management, security best practices
- 📝 **Automation & Scripting** - Bash scripts for monitoring, backups, and system maintenance
- 🌐 **Network Services** - Samba file sharing, remote access solutions, service hardening

## 🚀 Current Projects

- **[homelab-infrastructure](https://github.com/vhespir/homelab-infrastructure)** - System administration portfolio documenting my security implementations, monitoring infrastructure, and automation scripts
- **PasswordManager** - Secure password management application demonstrating encryption and security best practices
- **Monitoring Stack** - Running Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager with custom dashboards and Discord webhook integration

## 💻 Technical Skills

**Systems & Infrastructure**
- Linux (Arch Linux), systemd, networking, firewalls
- Docker, containerd, containerization
- Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, cAdvisor
- Samba, SSH, remote access solutions

**Security**
- Hardware authentication (FIDO2/U2F security keys)
- Intrusion prevention (fail2ban)
- Endpoint protection (ClamAV)
- Security monitoring and incident response
- System hardening and compliance

**Programming & Scripting**
- Bash (system automation, monitoring scripts)
- Java (object-oriented programming, applications)
- Python (learning for security tools and automation)
- Git version control

**Tools & Technologies**
- PAM configuration, systemd service management
- PromQL, log analysis, alerting
- Docker Compose, container security
- Backup and disaster recovery

## 📚 Learning & Goals

- Expanding security monitoring with SIEM solutions
- Exploring Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Building Python-based security tools
- Studying for security certifications (Security+, Linux+)

## 🏆 Highlighted Work

### Enterprise Monitoring Stack
Deployed complete observability infrastructure with Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager featuring:
- Custom Grafana dashboards for system health and security events
- Real-time alerting via Discord webhooks
- Multi-exporter configuration (node, blackbox, cAdvisor)
- Automated incident detection and response

### Hardware-Based Authentication
Implemented FIDO2/U2F security key authentication for privileged operations:
- PAM module configuration for hardware tokens
- Phishing-resistant, compliance-ready authentication
- Modern cryptographic security standards

### Infrastructure Automation
Created production-ready Bash scripts for:
- Comprehensive system health monitoring with threshold-based alerts
- Automated configuration backups with rotation and integrity verification
- Docker resource management and cleanup utilities
